# CMSAC Tidymodels Workshop

This workshop provides a gentle introduction to supervised machine learning: concepts, methods, and R code. Participants will learn how to apply a few common methods on open-source NFL data via nflfastR. Along the way, I'll introduce several core tidymodels packages, which provide a grammar for modeling that makes it easy to do the right thing, and harder to accidentally do the wrong thing.

### Source Code

There are a few files for you to use for source-code:  
- [`raw_plays.rds`](https://github.com/jthomasmock/nfl-workshop/blob/master/raw_plays.rds) - so you don't have to download ALL the `nflfastR` data
- [Full Code extracted from RMD Slides](https://github.com/jthomasmock/nfl-workshop/blob/master/tidymodels-code.R)
